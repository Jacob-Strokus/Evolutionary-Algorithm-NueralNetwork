================================================================================
📋 CURRENT PATHFINDING ARCHITECTURE:
1. 🧠 NEURAL NETWORK BASED: Decisions made through 10→12→4 neural network
2. 👁️ VISION-LIMITED: Agents only sense within vision range (15-20 units)
3. 🎯 SINGLE TARGET: Finds nearest food/threat/prey, no multi-target planning
4. 📐 ANGLE + DISTANCE: Uses polar coordinates for navigation
5. 🚫 NO PATHFINDING: Direct movement, no obstacle avoidance
6. 🧬 EVOLUTIONARY: Strategies evolve through genetic algorithm
7. ⚡ REACTIVE: Immediate response to current sensory input
8. 🎛️ INTENSITY CONTROL: Variable movement speed based on neural output

🧬 EVOLUTIONARY ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES:
==================================================
To make this truly evolution-driven, agents need enhanced capabilities:
1. 🧠 MEMORY SYSTEM: Short-term memory for recent locations/experiences
2. � MULTI-TARGET SENSING: See multiple food/threat sources simultaneously
3. 📡 COMMUNICATION: Simple signals between nearby agents
4. 🎯 VELOCITY AWARENESS: Sense movement direction of other agents
5. 🗺️ SPATIAL MEMORY: Remember productive areas over time
6. 🔄 RECURRENT CONNECTIONS: Enable temporal learning patterns
7. 🌐 VARIABLE NETWORK SIZE: Evolution can grow/shrink neural complexity
8. 🎲 EXPLORATION BIAS: Intrinsic motivation to explore unknown areas

🔧 CURRENT DESIGN-DRIVEN LIMITATIONS TO REMOVE:
❌ Fixed 'nearest only' target selection
❌ No memory of previous locations or food sources
❌ No path planning around obstacles
❌ No cooperative or flocking behaviors
❌ No predictive movement (intercepting moving targets)
❌ No area coverage strategies for exploration
❌ Simple greedy decision making

🎯 PROPOSED EVOLUTIONARY ARCHITECTURE:
✅ 15-20 input neurons with rich environmental data
✅ Variable hidden layer size (evolved trait)
✅ 3-cell memory buffer for recent states
✅ Multi-target sensing (3 nearest of each type)
✅ Communication output channel
✅ Recurrent connections for temporal patterns
✅ Exploration reward bonus in fitness function
✅ Social learning through observation
