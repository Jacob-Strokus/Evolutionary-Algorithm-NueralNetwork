## üîç Navigation Guide

### For New Contributors
1. Start with `PROJECT_STATUS.md` for current project overview
2. Review `project_phases/` to understand development history
3. Check `features/` for implemented functionality
4. Look at `bug_fixes/` for known issues and their resolutions

### For Bug Reporting
1. Check `bug_fixes/` first to see if the issue is already documented
2. Review related phase documentation in `project_phases/`
3. Use templates from `pull_requests/` for consistent reporting

### For Feature Development
1. Review `features/` for existing functionality
2. Check `project_phases/` for planned vs. implemented features
3. Follow patterns established in `pull_requests/` documentation

### For Maintenance
1. Check `maintenance/` for reorganization history
2. Review `bug_fixes/` for maintenance-related fixes
3. Use `images/` for visual documentation of changes

## üìñ Documentation Standards

### File Naming Convention
- Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.md` for major documentation
- Include descriptive suffixes like `_COMPLETE.md`, `_PLAN.md`, `_FIX.md`
- Prefix with category identifiers: `PR_`, `PHASE_`, etc.

### Content Structure
- Start with clear problem statement or objective
- Include comprehensive solution details
- Add testing and validation information
- Provide clear next steps or conclusions
- Use emojis for better visual organization

### Image Documentation
- Include descriptive filenames with context
- Store all images in the `images/` subfolder
- Reference images using relative paths: `images/filename.png`
- Provide alt text and captions for accessibility

## üîÑ Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Documentation
1. Determine the appropriate subfolder category
2. Follow established naming conventions
3. Include comprehensive content following project standards
4. Update this README if creating new categories

### Updating Existing Documentation
1. Maintain version history in git commits
2. Update related documentation for consistency
3. Verify all internal links and references
4. Update the main project README if needed

### Reorganization Principles
- Group by functionality and purpose
- Maintain chronological order within categories
- Preserve development history and context
- Keep related documentation together
