- 4 outputs (movement X/Y, reproduction, intensity)
- Fitness-based performance tracking
- Neural mutation and crossover

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Genetic Evolution
- Tournament selection for breeding
- Elite preservation (top 10-20% survive)
- Multi-point neural network crossover
- Adaptive mutation rates
- Population diversity maintenance
- Generational evolution tracking

## üéØ Neural Network Architecture

**Inputs (8 channels):**
1. Energy level (normalized)
2. Age (normalized)
3. Distance to nearest food
4. Angle to nearest food
5. Distance to nearest threat/prey
6. Angle to nearest threat/prey
7. Population density
8. Reproduction readiness

**Hidden Layer:** 12 neurons with tanh activation

**Outputs (4 channels):**
1. Movement X direction (-1 to 1)
2. Movement Y direction (-1 to 1)
3. Reproduction decision (0 to 1)
4. Action intensity (0 to 1)

## üìä Testing Status

- ‚úÖ **Neural Network Simulation**: Working correctly
