## 📊 Key Technical Achievements

### Neural Network Improvements
```
Before: Clamped directional inputs [-1.0, 1.0] → Lost precision
After:  Unit vectors with magnitude 1.0 → Perfect precision

Before: Random movement decisions → Poor food-seeking
After:  Evolutionary learning → Clear improvement over generations
```

### Fitness System Enhancement
```
- Movement Alignment: alignment = food_direction · agent_movement
- Positive Alignment: +25 points (max) for moving toward food
- Negative Alignment: -10 points (max) for moving away from food
- Safety Checks: math.isinf() and math.isnan() validation
```

### Evolution Performance
```
Generation 1: avg_fitness=45.32, 5 food consumed, 44% toward food
Generation 2: avg_fitness=53.68, 9 food consumed, 65% toward food  
Generation 3: avg_fitness=57.29, 13 food consumed, 33% toward food
Overall: +26% fitness improvement, +160% food consumption
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Opportunities
1. **Longer Evolution Runs**: Test with 10+ generations to see continued improvement
