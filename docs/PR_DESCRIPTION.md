# Fix Boundary Clustering Issue

## 🎯 Problem
Agents were moving toward and clustering at simulation boundaries instead of seeking food in the center, despite having boundary awareness systems in place.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
- Neural networks were initialized with random weights
- Food distance/angle inputs had equal influence to boundary inputs
- No initial bias toward food-seeking behavior
- Networks output random movement even when standing on food

## 🛠️ Solution Implemented

### Core Fixes in `src/neural/neural_agents.py`:
1. **Food-Seeking Weight Bias**: Initialize food input weights 3x stronger than default
2. **Boundary Weight Suppression**: Reduce boundary input weights to 0.2x of default  
3. **Movement Reduction on Food**: 80% movement reduction when food distance ≤ 0.01
4. **Enhanced Fitness Rewards**: Bonus for staying still near food sources
5. **Proper Neural Config**: Fixed input size from 8 to 10 for boundary awareness

### Additional Changes:
- Fixed `main.py` to use `env.step()` instead of `env.update()`
- Added comprehensive diagnostic tools

## 📊 Results

### Before Fix:
- Agents clustered at boundaries despite boundary awareness
- Random movement even when standing on food
- Poor food acquisition behavior

### After Fix:
- **Boundary distance ratio: 0.452** (agents staying well away from boundaries)
- **Only 19% agents in boundary zone** (down from ~70%+)
- **19% agents in center zone** (improved distribution)
- **Active food consumption: 0.76 per agent**
- ✅ **SUCCESS: Agents now exhibit natural food-seeking behavior**

## 🧪 Testing
- `debug_boundary_clustering.py`: Analyzes agent decisions at different positions
- `verify_boundary_fix.py`: Tests agent distribution after fixes
- `analyze_neural_weights.py`: Examines neural network weight patterns
- Full simulation runs successfully with evolution through multiple generations

## 📁 Files Modified
- `src/neural/neural_agents.py` - Core boundary clustering fixes
- `main.py` - Fixed method call
- Added diagnostic tools for future analysis

This fix resolves the boundary clustering issue and restores natural food-seeking behavior in the neural ecosystem simulation.
