## üöÄ Usage

To run any script, navigate to the EA-NN root directory and use:

```bash
python scripts/subfolder/script_name.py
```

For example:
```bash
python scripts/carnivore_testing/test_carnivore_fixes.py
python scripts/neural_visualization/validate_neural_fix.py
```

## üìà Development History

This organization reflects the iterative development process of the EA-NN project:

1. **Phase 1**: Basic ecosystem setup and initial debugging
2. **Phase 2**: Carnivore balance issues identification and fixing
3. **Phase 3**: Neural network visualization bug fixes
4. **Phase 4**: Boundary clustering and spatial behavior improvements

Each subfolder contains scripts that were developed to address specific phases of development, making it easier to understand the project's evolution and maintain related functionality together.

## üîÑ Maintenance

When adding new scripts:
1. Determine the primary focus/category of the script
2. Place it in the appropriate subfolder
3. Update this README if creating a new category
4. Ensure the script follows the project's coding standards

This organization helps maintain a clean and navigable codebase while preserving the development history and making it easier for contributors to find relevant scripts for specific functionality areas.
